# Data Mining, Analysis, ML and Visualizations

Welcome to the Python repository! This project showcases my work in the fields of data mining, machine learning, CNN, and visualizations. Below, you'll find an overview of the project's purpose, key features, and how to get started.

## Purpose

This repository houses my codes and projects related to extracting valuable insights from data through various techniques, including data mining, thorough analysis, and compelling visualizations. Whether you're interested in exploring datasets, understanding patterns, building ML models or creating informative visual representations, this repository has something for you.

## Key Features

- **Data Mining:** Uncover hidden patterns, trends, and relationships in datasets.
- **Analysis:** Perform in-depth analysis to derive meaningful insights and draw conclusions.
- **Visualizations:** Create compelling visualizations to communicate findings effectively.
- **Machine Learning:** Create effective ML models to make predictions and drive business insights.
- **Deep Learning:** Deployed deep learnng models, such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** [Python]

## Projects

Explore the following projects within this repository:

1. [EDA_Airport_data]: EDA for huge datasets about airports across US, with the purpose of finding patterns and meaningful insights.
2. [Gas$Oil_Trading_Analytics_Report]: Consulted a Gas&Oil Trading company with insights to become more profitable.
3. [ModelsPerformance_students]: Feature Engineering techniques and various ML models to find the best predictor of colleges' students dropout/graduate levels. 
4. [StartupSuccess_prediction]: Build an accurate ML model to 'redict the likelyhood of a startup to be successful, based on particular features (dynamic user input!).

Each project folder contains detailed information, code, and documentation.
